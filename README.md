TernaryCalc
===========

This small console app is a ternary calc. It uses the Ncalc library (under MIT licence) to parse the operation.

The working system is simple : 

* Ask a ternary operation to the user (10*2+11)
* Convert the line to the base 10 (3*2+4)
* Execute the operation with Ncalc ( 10 )
* Convert the result to base 3 ( 101 )
* Show the result ( 10*2+11 = 101)
